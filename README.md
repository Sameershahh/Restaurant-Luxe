# Primal Kitchen — Luxury Restaurant Frontend

Primal Kitchen is a cinematic, high-end restaurant website frontend inspired by premium hospitality and fine-dining brands. The project focuses on immersive visuals, structured typography, refined animations, and disciplined layout composition to reflect a luxury steakhouse aesthetic.

This project was built to demonstrate advanced frontend design principles, animation control, layout hierarchy, and brand-focused UI execution using modern web technologies.

- Structured grid systems

- High-quality image placement
- Subtle scroll-based animation
- Fine-dining menu typography layout
- Masonry-style gallery presentation
